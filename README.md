# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project

## Overview
This project implements a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system using custom data. The goal is to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories such as PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, and others.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ner-project.git
cd ner-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `spacy` or `transformers` (depending on the model you choose)
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## Data
### Dataset Description
Describe the custom dataset used for the NER task. Include information such as:
- Source of the data
- Size of the dataset
- Format (e.g., JSON, CSV, etc.)
- Entity categories (e.g., PERSON, ORGANIZATION)

### Data Preprocessing
Explain any preprocessing steps performed on the data, such as:
- Text cleaning
- Tokenization
- Annotating entities

## Model
### Model Selection
Detail the models used for NER, such as:
- Rule-based models
- Machine learning models (e.g., CRF, SVM)
- Deep learning models (e.g., BERT, LSTM)

### Training
Outline how the model was trained:
- Hyperparameters used
- Training-validation split
- Training duration

## Usage
Provide instructions on how to run the NER system:
```bash
python main.py --input data/input_text.txt --output results/output.json
```
Explain the command-line arguments and their usage.

## Evaluation
Describe the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

### Results
Include a summary of the results obtained from the evaluation:
- Performance metrics
- Sample predictions
